<h1>Importing a sqlReport</h1>
<p>Prior to importing a sqlReport, it is necessary to have an exported file of an existing report.  The file will have xml coding.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate your web browser to the sqlReports home page.</li>
<li>Click the Import a new sqlReport link.</li>
<li>Outside of the browser, open a previously exported sqlReport file in a text editor.</li>
<li>Copy the entire contents of the file, paste them in the text box on the sqlReport Import page, make any necessary changes, such as report group information, and click the Submit button.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Exporting a sqlReport</h1>
<p>After creating a sqlReport, it is possible to export it and share it with another user.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate your web browser to the sqlReports home page.</li>
<li>Click the Edit link of the sqlReport you wish to export.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the page, right click on the export this report link.</li>
<li>In the dialog box that appears, choose Save Link As and specify a name and location for the file.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Teacher Version</h1>
<p>Teachers will be able to run reports you create in sqlReports, but will not be able to edit or create new ones.  The reports will act in a similar manner as they do on the admin side - teachers will be able to use the features of a report, including using optional parameters, and will only see reports assigned to them.</p>

<p>Reports assigned to teachers will be assigned using the Run Access tab of the sqlReport itself.  You need to make sure your teachers are assigned to an admin Default Group via the Security Setting page in the staff information area, or to a role in the school that is attached to a group.  On the Admin Access and Roles page for a teacher, you do not need to check the parts to sign in to the admin portion or supply admin usernames or passwords, you just need to make sure the teacher is in a group or is in a role with a group tied to it.  For example, if a teacher was assigned to group 10, but assigned to a role that is tied to group 5, any reports assigned to group 5 will be seen by the teacher.</p>

<h1>Features when Creating or Editing a sqlReport</h1>
<ul>
<li>Report Name - Identifying name of the report.</li>
<li>Report Title - Title to appear at the top of report.  <br><br><b>IMPORTANT</b>:  Do not use double quotes in your Report Title.  Doing so will cause the report to not output correctly because the double quotes will cause html issues on the report output page.  Buttons will not display and row colors will be off.</li><br>
<li>Add After Title - Allows you to add information after the title to the report.  You can use it to add the value from Parameter 1, the current date, or both. For example, if it's the student drop-down, the name of the student will appear after the report title.</li>
<li>Report Group - Name of group to help organize reports.  This can be left blank.</li>
<li>Report Description - Information describing the characteristics of the report such as information about the parameters.</li>
<li>SQL Query - The actual SQL query that will be used to produce the report output.  If possible, test your query in a sql client to catch any errors.  <br><br><b>IMPORTANT</b>:  Do not use double quotes around field aliases in the select clause in the SQL Query (double quotes will cause HTML issues).  Also, do not use any tlist_sql reserved characters, such as colons and semi-colons. For a colon use chr(58) and for a semi-colon use chr(59).  If you're concatenating and need a comma, use chr(44) instead.  To display the external expression in a report (the external expression is sometimes different than the value in the expression field), add externalexpression as an alias to the expression field in your select.  For example, if your sql has cc.expression as one of the fields, use cc.expression externalexpression in the select.  The externalexpression alias will trigger coding in the report to display the external expression when the report output is displayed.</li><br>
<li>Column Headings - Column headings for the report separated by table cell tags.  The header columns are sortable when the report is displayed. Place-holders for headings will be automatically generated by <b>Build Headings</b> link.  Default generated headings will appear as Column1, Column2, etc.<br><br><b>IMPORTANT</b>:  In the Column Headings box, make sure you have a heading for each part of your main select, otherwise your report output will be off.  Do not press enter after any report header - just keep them all on a continuous line.  Pressing enter after any of them will cause white space to appear above the report.  Buttons will not display and row colors will be off if the number of Column Headings is wrong.<br><br>With Column Headings, there are five class= commands you can use in a &ltth&gt: DCID, DCID DISPLAY, HIDE, NOCF, and ROWGRP.  
<br>
DCID or DCID DISPLAY - used with the make current selection button.  These are explained under the Student Selection tab.
<br>HIDE - can be used to hide a column needed for the SQL but you don't want to display on the output, or could be used with the show/hide columns button when you want to hide columns initially that the user can show using the show/hide button.
<br>NOCF - used when Column Filtering is enabled and you want to remove filtering for a visible column or columns.
<br>ROWGRP - used when Row Grouping is enabled and designates the column to use for row grouping purposes.<br><br>
<li>Convert td's to th's - The Build Header link will add th commands as part of the headers, such as &lt;th&gt;Column1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Column2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Column3&lt;/th&gt;.  Previous versions of sqlReports added td commands , however, to take advantage of the full functionality of sqlReports 4, the th should be used instead.  The <b>Convert td's to th's</b> link will convert older column headings to th.  The column headings will not be changed, just the td's to th's.</li>
<li>Field Level Security - Use this box to enforce field level security on reports.  If a person has No Access level security to a field, it will print just *'s on the report for that field.  Clicking on the <b>Build Map Field</b> will create a generic mapfield command which you use as a guide.  You'll need to replace the table.fieldname parts with the actual table and field names (do not use aliases - use the actual names for both), and remove any part of the coding that you do not need.<br><br><b>IMPORTANT</b>:  Starting with version 4.5, you can add field level security to your reports.  If a person has No Access rights to a field, you can include the field in the report and *'s will appear instead of the actual value on the output.  To invoke field level security in sqlReports, you must have coding in the Field Level Security box, which follows the format of mapfield=column#>table.fieldname.  If there's more than one column, add a comma, and then another column#>table.fieldname.  The column# will be the column number in the Column Headings box, and table.fieldname will be replaced by actual table and field names.<br><br>For example, if you have the DOB field from the students table in a report, and in the Column Headings box that is column 2, then it would look like mapfield=2>students.dob.  If you also have a reference to the SSN field in the report and that's in column 5, then the full command would be mapfield=2>students.dob,5>students.ssn.</li><br>
<li>Exclude From User List - Check this box if you do not wish to have the report listed for end users.  The report will still be included for administrators and will display <img src="/images/btn_reports_cancel.gif" border="0"> next to the Edit <img src="/images/btn_edit.gif" border="0"> icon.</li>
<li>Last Run Info - The username, date and time are logged for the last execution of the report.</li>
</ul> 
</div>
</div>

<div id="ParametersTab">
<div class="box-round">
<ul>
<li>Directions - Use this area to write out detailed instructions for the admin or teacher to follow when running the report.</li>
<li>Parameters 1-5 - Optional parameters to allow for end user flexibility.  Parameters can be used in the WHERE clause of your sql query or in ~[if...] commands.  To use a parameter, simply embed the %param#% code in your query - be sure param is all lowercase.  Replace the # with the number of the Parameter, such as %param1%, %param2%, etc.<br><br>
	  For example, if the WHERE clause contained the following:<br>
	  <b>WHERE schoolid=100 AND gender='F'</b><br><br>
	  We can make the schoolid parameter based and at runtime, the report will prompt for the end user for a value.  Simple change the WHERE clause to look like this:<br>
	  <b>WHERE schoolid=%param1% AND gender='%param2%'</b><br><br>
	  Parameter 1 could be called School Number.<br>
	  Parameter 2 could be called Gender. <br /><br />
</li>
<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>:  The initial value is only used the first time a report is run.  After that, the last value used is saved in that field.  If you want a calendar popup to be next to the text entry box, check this option.  It will be ignored if a drop down is used.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div id="StuSelTab">
<div class="box-round">
<p><b>Student Selection Tab - Only One Option Needs to be Used</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Student Selection Query (Option A) - used in previous versions and is a query that will create a comma separated list of Student dcids.  It should be a slight variation of the query.  To simplify the process, the Build Query function will try to build the selection query.  It essentially uses the FROM clause from the sql query and prepends the clause 'SELECT DISTINCT Students.DCID'.  The selection will involve all the students returned in the query.  Does not need to be filled out if you're using Option B instead.</li>
<li>Student Selection Query (Option B - implemented starting with sqlReports 4.  Will add a button to the output, that when clicked, will make those students on the screen the current selection.  If the results have been filtered down, only those remaining will become the current selection.  See information on the Student Selection page on what is involved to use this option.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="RunAccessTab">
<div class="box-round">
<p><b>Run Access Tab</b></p>
<ul>
      <li>Executable Groups - allows you to choose specific groups that can run the report.   Use CTRL/OPT to make multiple selections of groups or set the group to the default blank selection for access to all groups.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="ResultsPageTab">
<div class="box-round">
<h1>Use Non-Flash Buttons</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use Non-Flash Buttons - Will use HTML5 buttons on the output page rather than Flash buttons.  A <img src="/images/icon-html.gif" height="16" width="16" border="0"> icon will appear to the right of the report title in the sqlReports home page to signify it's a chart report.  <br><br><b>IMPORTANT</b>:  If the 'Use HTML5 Buttons on all Reports' option has been checked in the sqlReports Preferences area, the check box will be grayed out and not in use.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Create as a Chart</h1>
<ul>
<li>Create output as a Chart - Will provide chart options when the report is run.  A <img src="/images/icon-credits.gif" height="16" width="16" border="0"> icon will appear to the right of the report title in the sqlReports home page to signify it's a chart report.</li>
<li>Initial Chart - When the chart options appear, this will be the initial chart selected.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Page Buttons</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hide the Copy Button - A Copy button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
<li>Hide the CSV Button - A CSV button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
<li>Hide the Tab Button - A Tab button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
<li>Hide the Print Button - A Print button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
<li>Hide the PDF Button - A PDF button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
<li>Show the Show/Hide Columns Button - Check this box to show the Show/hide Columns button for that report.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Page Options</h1>
<ul>
<li>Open in New Window - Check this box if you would like to open the report in a new window or tab.</li>
<li>Display Debug Info - Use this option if you would like to see the sql with the values from parameters or system variables, which helps troubleshoot your sql by letting you see if values are working correctly.  A link will appear at the top of the results page that can be clicked to see the sql.  Another link will allow you to view any Oracle errors in the System Log.</li>
<li>Hide the Parameter Line - Check this box if you would like to hide the Parameters line.  If there are no parameters, the line will hide by default.</li>
<li>Show Gridlines - Check this box if you would like gridlines on the output table.</li>
<li>Include Row Numbers - Check this box if you would like to include row numbers in the returned data.  They will appear in the first column.</li>
<li>Show the Search Box - You can check this box to include a search box in the top right of the output.  Users can type in criteria and only those rows that meet that criteria will show.  If you click on any of the buttons - Make Current Selection, Copy, CSV, Tab, PDF - only the results on the screen will be used with them.</li>
<li>Show Results Info Line - You can check this box to include a line at the bottom of the report that will show how may total rows are displayed.  If you do a search, the line will show how many lines remain out of total original lines.</li>
<li>Enable Column Filtering - You can check this box to enable filtering by column.  All columns on the output will have a filter unless you add class="NOCF" to the column heading in the Report Header section.</li>
<br><b>IMPORTANT</b>:  Column Filtering does not interact well with Show/Hide Columns or Column Reordering.  If you enable either Column Filtering, Show/Hide Columns and Column Reordering will be disabled on the output.  Column Filtering needs the search box, so the search box will appear even if it hasn't been checked.<br><br>
<li>Enable Column Reordering - You can check this box to enable the ability to drag and drop columns into different places on the output.  If you click on any of the buttons - Copy, CSV, Tab, PDF - the order the columns appear is how they appear in the results.</li>
<li>Enable Row Grouping - will group rows together in the output based on a common column.  You designate the column to use by adding class="ROWGRP" to the column in the Report Header.</li>
<br><b>IMPORTANT</b>:  Row Grouping does not interact well with Show/Hide Columns or Column Reordering.  If you enable Row Grouping, Show/Hide Columns and Column Reordering will be disabled on the output.  Also, Row Grouping causes issues with Option B Student Selection, which is the one that adds the Make Current Selection button.  It will add erroneous information to the dcid values and make the selection incorrect.  If you have Row Grouping enabled, then Option B will be ignored and no Make Current Selection button will appear on the output<br><br>
<li>Show Row Grouping in Descending Order - By default, when row grouping is used, the groups are shown in ascending order.  Check this box to use descending order instead.</li>
<li>Display Column Used for Row Grouping - If you plan to copy, export, or print the information and want the column used for row grouping to be included, you will need to use this option.</li>
<li>Show Row Grouping Counts - This option will add a count to the grouping row that will show how many rows are part of that grouping.</li>
      <li>Enable the Fixed Header Row - You can check this box to lock in the column header at the top of the screen when someone scrolls down the results.</li>
      <li>Disable Multiple Row Selection - By default, you can click on rows on the output and highlight them.  If you then click on any of the buttons - Make Current Selection, Copy, CSV, Tab, PDF - only the results on the screen will be used with them.  Checking this box disables that feature.</li>
      <li>Use Landscape for PDF - Will print the report in landscape orientation when using the PDF button.  If unchecked, the report will be in portrait orientation.</li>
      <li>No Double Quotes Around Data on CSV Export - By default, the output of CSV files is a double quote around the data.  This removes the double quotes.  Do not uncheck if the data has commas though, such as the lastfirst student field.</li>
      <li>No Header Row on CSV or Tab Export - By default, the output of a CSV or Tab files contains a header row with column titles.  This option removes the header row from the export.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="NotesTab">
<div class="box-round">
<p><b>Notes Tab</b></p>
<ul>
      <li>Notes - Use the text box to record information about the report, such as when it was imported or create, any changes, etc.  Starting with 4.5a, this page will show when a report was imported or created and the last update to the report.</li>
