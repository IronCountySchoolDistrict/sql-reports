sqlReports Drop Downs

There are instructions on creating you own drop-downs under the Resources, Articles area of www.sisresources.com.


IMPORTANT:  Be sure to make back up the dropdowns folder and any copies of the files mentioned in steps 2 and 3 prior to any upgrades of sqlReports or deleting and reinstalling a plugin so that you don't lose any changes.
