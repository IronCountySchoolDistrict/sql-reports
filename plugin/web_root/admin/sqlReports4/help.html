<h1>sqlReports 4 Help - version 4.7.0 - June 1, 2016</h1>
<p>Welcome to sqlReports Help. sqlReports should be a quick and easy way to distribute SQL queries to your end users without leaving the PowerSchool environment.  The sqlReports home page will display a list of reports (queries) that can be executed.  End users simply click on the name of the report and will be prompted to enter any optional paramters prior to the report being run.</p>

<h1>Features when Creating or Editing a sqlReport</h1>
<p><b>Report Tab</b></p>
<ul>
	  <li>Report Name - Identifying name of the report.</li>
      <li>Report Title - Title to appear at the top of report.</li>
      <li>Add After Title - Allows you to add information from Parameter 1 to the report.  For example, if it's the student drop-down, the name of the student will appear after the report title.  Comes in handy for reports for individual students that are printer or printed to PDF.</li>
      <li>Report Group - Name of group to help organize reports.  This can be left blank.</li>
          <li>Report Description - Information describing the characteristics of the report such as information about the parameters.</li>
      <li>SQL Query - The actual SQL query that will be used to produce the report output.  If possible, test your query in a sql client to catch any errors. </li>
          <li>Report Header - Column headers for the report separated by table cell tags.  The header columns are sortable when the report is displayed. Place-holders for headers will be automatically generated by <b>Build Header</b> link.  Default generated headers will appear as Column1, Column2, etc.</li>
<li>Convert td's to th's - The Build Header link will add th commands as part of the headers, such as &lt;th&gt;Column1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Column2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Column3&lt;/th&gt;.  Previous versions of sqlReports added td commands , however, to take advantage of the full functionality of sqlReports 4, the th should be used instead.  The <b>Convert td's to th's</b> link will convert older column headings to th.  The column headings will not be changed, just the td's to th's.</li>
          <li>Field Level Security - Use this box to enforce field level security on reports.  If a person has No Access level security to a field, it will print just *'s on the report for that field.  Clicking on the <b>Build Map Field</b> will provide a sample line of coding to use that must be edited for actual use.  Click on the "Important Information Regarding Field Level Security" line after the Last Run Info line for detailed help on how to use this feature.</li>
    <li>Exclude From User List - Check this box if you do not wish to have the report listed for end users.  The report will still be included for administrators and will display <img src="/images/btn_reports_cancel.gif" border="0"> next to the Edit <img src="/images/btn_edit.gif" border="0"> icon.</li>
      <li>Last Run Info - The username, date and time are logged for the last execution of the report.  This might be handy to determine if a report or query becomes outdated.</li>
    </ul> 
<p><b>Parameters Tab</b></p>
<ul>
      <li>Directions - Use this area to write out detailed instructions for the admin or teacher to follow when running the report.</li>
      <li>Parameters 1-5 - Optional parameters to allow for end user flexibility.  Parameters can be used in the WHERE clause of your sql query.  To use a parameter, simply embed the %param1% code in your query to use Parameter 1.<br><br>
	  For example, if our WHERE clause contained the following:<br>
	  <b>WHERE schoolid=100 AND gender='F'</b><br><br>
	  We can make the schoolid parameter based and at runtime, the report will prompt for the end user for a value.  Simple change the WHERE clause to look like this:<br>
	  <b>WHERE schoolid=%param1% AND gender='%param2%'</b><br><br>
	  Parameter 1 could be called School Number and have a default value of 100.<br>
	  Parameter 2 could be called Gender and have a default value of F. <br /><br />
	  With each parameter you can add either a calendar or a drop-down menu.  See the description below Parameter 5 for more information about both.
	  </li>
    </ul>
<p><b>Student Selection Tab - Only One Option Needs to be Used</b></p>
<ul>
      <li>Student Selection Query (Option A) - used in previous versions and is a query that will create a comma separated list of Student dcids.  It should be a slight variation of the query.  To simplify the process, the Build Query function will try to build the selection query.  It essentially uses the FROM clause from the sql query and prepends the clause 'SELECT DISTINCT Students.DCID'.  The selection will involve all the students returned in the query.</li>
      <li>Student Selection Query (Option B - implemented starting with sqlReports 4 and is where a button is added to the output, that when clicked, will make those students on the screen the current selection.  The current selection is just those students on the screen, so if filter has been enabled and the results filtered down, only those remaining will become the current selection.  See information on the Student Selection page on what is involved to use this option.</li>
    </ul>
<p><b>Run Access Tab</b></p>
<ul>
      <li>Executable Groups - One to many of the built-in security groups that are allowed to execute or run the sqlReport.  Use CTRL/OPT to make multiple selections of groups or set the group to the default blank selection for access to all groups.</li>
    </ul>
<p><b>Results Page Tab</b></p>
<ul>
      <li>Create output as a Chart - Will provide chart options when the report is run.  A <img src="/images/icon-credits.gif" height="16" width="16" border="0"> icon will appear to the right of the report title in the sqlReports home page to signify it's a chart report.</li>
      <li>Initial Chart - When the chart options appear, this will be the initial chart selected.</li>
      <li>Hide the Copy Button - A Copy button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
      <li>Hide the CSV Button - A CSV button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
      <li>Hide the Tab Button - A Tab button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
         <li>Hide the Print Button - A Print button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
      <li>Hide the PDF Button - A PDF button will appear on the output by default, but you can check this box to hide it for that report.</li>
      <li>Show the Show/Hide Columns Button - Check this box to show the Show/hide Columns button for that report.</li>
      <li>Open in New Window - Check this box if you would like to open the report in a new window or tab.</li>
      <li>Display Debug Info - Use this option if you would like to see the sql with the values from parameters or system variables.  It helps troubleshoot your sql by letting you see if values are working correctly.  A link will appear at the top of the results page that can be clicked to see the sql.</li>
      <li>Hide the Parameter Line - Check this box if you would like to hide the Parameters line.  If there are no parameters, the line will hide by default.</li>
      <li>Show Gridlines - Check this box if you would like gridlines on the output table.</li>
      <li>Include Row Numbers - Check this box if you would like to include row numbers in the returned data.  They will appear in the first column.</li>
      <li>Show the Search Box - You can check this box to include a search box in the top right of the output.  Users can type in criteria and only those rows that meet that criteria will show.  If you click on any of the buttons - Make Current Selection, Copy, CSV, Tab, PDF - only the results on the screen will be used with them.</li>
      <li>Show Results Info Line - You can check this box to include a line at the bottom of the report that will show how may total rows are displayed.  If you do a search, the line will show how many lines remain out of total original lines.</li>
      <li>Enable Column Filtering - You can check this box to enable filtering by column.  All columns on the output will have a filter unless you add class="NOCF" to the column heading in the Report Header section.</li>
      <li>Enable Column Reordering - You can check this box to enable the ability to drag and drop columns into different places on the output.  If you click on any of the buttons - Copy, CSV, Tab, PDF - the order the columns appear is how they appear in the results.</li>
      <li>Show Row Grouping in Descending Order - By default, when row grouping is used, the groups are shown in ascending order.  Check this box to use descending order instead.</li>
      <li>Display Column Used for Grouping - If you plan to copy, export, or print the information and want the column used for row grouping to be included, you will need to use this option.</li>
      <li>Show Row Grouping Counts - This option will add a count to the grouping row that will show how many rows are part of that grouping.</li>
      <li>Enable the Fixed Header Row - You can check this box to lock in the column header at the top of the screen when someone scrolls down the results.</li>
      <li>Disable Multiple Row Selection - By default, you can click on rows on the output and highlight them.  If you then click on any of the buttons - Make Current Selection, Copy, CSV, Tab, PDF - only the results on the screen will be used with them.  Checking this box disables that feature.</li>
      <li>Use Landscape for PDF - Will print the report in landscape orientation when using the PDF button.  If unchecked, the report will be in portrait orientation.</li>
      <li>No Double Quotes Around Data on CSV Export - By default, the output of CSV files is a double quote around the data.  This removes the double quotes.  Do not uncheck if the data has commas though, such as the lastfirst student field.</li>
      <li>No Header Row on CSV or Tab Export - By default, the output of a CSV or Tab files contains a header row with column titles.  This option removes the header row from the export.</li>
    </ul>
<p><b>Notes Tab</b></p>
<ul>
      <li>Notes - Use the text box to record information about the report, such as when it was imported or create, any changes, etc.  Starting with 4.5a, this page will show when a report was imported or created and the last update to the report.</li>
</ul>

<h1>sqlReports 4 Help - Teacher Version</h1>
<p>Teachers will be able to run reports you create in sqlReports 4, but will not be able to edid or create new ones.  The reports will act in a similar manner as they do on the admin side - teachers will be able to use the features of a report, including using optional parameters, and will only see reports assigned to them.</p>
<h1>Groups</h1>
<p>Reports assigned to teachers will be assigned using the Run Access tab of the sqlReport itself.  You need to make sure your teachers are assigned to an admin Default Group via the Security Setting page in the staff information area, or to a role in the school that is attached to a group.  On the Admin Access and Roles page for a teacher, you do not need to check the parts to sign in to the admin portion or supply admin usernames or passwords, you just need to make sure the teacher is in a group or is in a role with a group tied to it.  For example, if a teacher was assigned to group 10, but assigned to a role that is tied to group 5, any reports assigned to group 5 will be seen by the teacher.</p>
